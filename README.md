# Weight-And-See

## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to give users the ability to track their workouts throughout the day. They can also view their stats for the week to see their progress and draw backs. This gives users the ability to track their progress and then be able to set realistic goals for the future

## Development Process
This application uses Mongo DB and Express. By utilizing API routes I was able to wire up this application to get the given code to talk to a Mongo database that I had created. 

## Challenges
Some of the challenges was understanding the given code enough to then know how to implement the back end server for the front end code to interact with. Once this was figured out through a myriad of trial and error getting the routes set up correctly became clearer. 

## Future Development
Currently the app does not route back to the main index page once a work out is created or updated. This bug will need to be fixed in future developments. Other than that this application works.
